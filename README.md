# Yatharth’s collection of miscellaneous Homebrew formulae

These are mostly for personal use.


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install yatharth/misc/<formula>`

Or `brew tap yatharth/misc` and then `brew install <formula>`.


## What’s the list of formulae available?

- `wolframlpha-cli`, which provides a simple executable `wa` to query WolframAlpha from the command line.


## What are some helpful guides for making Homebrew formulae?

I liked these:

- [betterprogramming.pub][] to create a tap on Github and write a simple formula for an executable
- [gabecc.me][] for merging into homebrew-core and for formulae with compilation
